## ✨ Features

- Postgres

## 💁‍♀️ How to use

- Click the `Deploy on pipeops` button
- Set up a `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` to secure your endpoints and console.

## 📝 Notes

- This starter automagically provisions a PostgreSQL database for you when you click the `Deploy on pipeops`. The `DATABASE_URL` enviroment variable used in the `Dockerfile` is picked up from there.
- The hasura console and dev mode are enabled by default for a better development experience. You may want to read the [production checklist](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/deployment/production-checklist.html) before going live with your app.
